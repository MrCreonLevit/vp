NOTE many of these bugs have already been fixed. Need to updgta ethis file to reflect it.

BUG - cancel from quit ater creating more windows deletes soem windows on mac (re-appeared).
BUG - merge data resets all plots, axes, etc.  Bummer.
BUG - renormalizing one axis resets all axes i a plot.  Bummer.
BUG delimiter characters don't work right.  Column headers (and data?) containing blanks get parsed as multiple fields, even when delimiter is, say, a comma.
BUG - working matlab function
BUG - keyboard hsortcuts do not work in control panels.

rewrite:
consistent coding, naming, and commenting.  - Creon to email to Paul GMAT coding standards

features:
**solo selection, solo next, solo previous.
*transpose x-y.
*duplicate plot (from another plot)
**write all/write selected option in write file
**write selection state option in write file
**save state  -- Pual
*column class - deferred
*axis class? - deferred
**tutorials - Creon
circular selections
  (will need to resurrect paint mode for this)
one-dimensional selections with left, right, center & width(?) slider bars.
rotated rectangle
paint w/selection
folding, spreading, and striding (see Notes.creon 7 Aug 07 & 14 Oct 07)
lines (instead of just points)
table view
expanding sub-panels
trackball rotation
"randomized" normalization
mutual information 2d, 3d
1D vertex array VBO vertex program
separate 2D plots from 3D plots.  Save memory.
separate normalization(s) from transformation(s).  
separate viewing xforms from "batch" data xforms.
  diferent viewing xforms can use the same (1D vertex program) vertex data.
speed up conditional estimates.  Add progress bars wih cancelation.
half float framebuffers / PBOs.
fltk 2.0 or wxWidgets
zoom to selection (smooth)
zoom center at mouse down.
tansform by piping columns to external program and reading columns back.
keyboard shortcuts need to be consistent across the app.
  r - reset one plot
  R - reset all plots
  c - clear one brush... etc.
Need to have keyboard arrows do the right thing in sliders.
Need "fine control mode" in sliders.
Grids
Smart tickmarks.
Mouse position readout.
time series (row#) offsets per axis.
full GPU implementation (see 4 April 07)
axis sliders (as opposed to menus) for rapid changing of axes.
